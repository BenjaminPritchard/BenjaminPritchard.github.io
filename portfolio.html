# PORTFOLIO

I am the original author of the **Kundalini Piano Mirror,** which is software for use with a [physical] digital piano to creates a mirror-image ("left handed") piano, which helps pianists develop ambidexterity and novel inter-hemispheric coordination. Additionally, the piano mirror software also supports user-defined scripting in the LUA language, which helps pianist achieve novel musical effects, such as bringing out certain voicing in polyphonic music, or creating mathematically-perfect crescendos or decrescendos.

This software (which is also available in a physical form factor) will revolutionize music education as it is adopted, especially as children are introduced to music in this way.

I am also the original author of the **Mozart Transposition Engine**, which is a custom-developed software tool-chain for creating transposed, mirror image scores for use with the Kundalini Piano Mirroring Platform.

Additionally, I am also the author of the **Bach-In-The-Mirror project,** which uses the Mozart-Transposition Engine to display all fifteen of the Two Part Inventions by Johann Sebastian Bach, in all keys and with optional symmetrical inversion in each key. (The scores are produced with my Mozart Transposition Engine, are typeset with GNU Lilypond.)

(Bach-In-The-Mirror is the first example usage of the Mozart-Transposition Engine. Subsequent projects will move onto other famous works, such as the Chopin Etudes.)

Finally, I am also the author of **Van Gogh Flow**, which is interesting software to gently induce psychological flow states by utilizing a composite window manager to overly one's display with pulsating visualizations.

(Van Gogh Flow represents a major innovation in the ability to modulate between diffuse and focused -mode thinking styles, and is a novel and aesthetically-pleasing way to increase one's creativity.)

Another project that I am very proud of are the Tampermonkey scripts I wrote to help encourage people to contribute to Simple Wikipedia.

Finally, I am also very proud of the work I am doing to create beginner-friendly programming posts to help people get into programming, such as for example:
